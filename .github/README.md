# Spider Web Node

This is a system of representation, movement and elimination of interconnected nodes.

## Controls

The controls for operating the program are as follows:

|         Key         | Action                                  |
| :-----------------: | :-------------------------------------- |
|    `Mouse left`     | Creates a node at the cursor position   |
|    `Mouse right`    | If a node is clicked on it can be moved |
| `del` **or** `supr` | Delete all nodes on the screen          |

## Example

This would be a small example of what can be done with the program.
